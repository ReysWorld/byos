# BYOS - Build Your Own Site
BYOS is a collection of small and simple modules to include in your website.

This is not a CSS framework by any means. All modules are completely stand-alone and without any dependencies.

## base.css
This is just a small basic CSS file for resetting and to add that sweet Verdana font for the right look and feel.

Not really necessary for the individual modules.

## Navigation
A simple sticky top navigation with an included hamburger/air vent/mobile menu. Fully responsive and purely created with CSS. No Javascript needed.
